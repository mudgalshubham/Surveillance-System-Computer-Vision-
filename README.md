# CSCI 5722: Computer Vision Fall 2016 Final Project
## Surveillance System (Face Recognition)

Steps to follow to run the code:

	•	Run the file ‘detectAndTrackFaces.m’ from the main folder.
	•	Choose if you want to use the already made classifier or train the classifier with the data already present in the folder ‘cv_imageset’.
	•	Choose if you want video feed from an already uploaded video or from the webcam.
	•	Choose if unknown faces should be detected or not. If detected, then it would say as ‘unknown’ otherwise it wouldn’t detect the face at all.
